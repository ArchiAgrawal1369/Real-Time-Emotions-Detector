# Real-Time-Emotions-Detector

Expressing through human facial emotions is still the most fundamental way of communication. There has been an active research over the last few decades in this field but it is still challenging due to the high intra-class variation, cross-cultural variability, nonverbal cues, high intra-class variation and variations in head pose, illumination, and occlusions. Thespis.AI is a step in the direction of more accurately and efficiently recognizing human facial emotions of a diverse population. The aim of Thespis.AI is to identify human facial emotions in real time.
In this project, we have identified faces using haarcascade algorithm for face detection and have implemented a deep convolutional neural networks model for facial expression recognition (FER) training to achieve greater accuracy.
